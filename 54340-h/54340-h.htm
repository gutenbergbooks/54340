  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In offering the following practical dissertation
(the first ever yet published) upon the Art of
Architectural Modelling, the Author feels that he
is supplying a want that must have been long felt
by many students and others in the architectural
profession. The utility of the “Model,” coupled
with its beauty, is ample recommendation of the
study; and the modeller will be able to furnish
the architect with sure and certain means that
he may find weighty difficulties surmounted,
especially in the case of uncomprehending clients,
by giving to them the designs of their edifices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>with a distinctness almost equal to the real
work when completed. With many clients, even
“perspectives” are poorly understood, which
seldom fails to cause some slight dissatisfaction
on their part when they see too late certain things
that the eye would have detected in the model
and corrected in the outset. Models are becoming
very general, where buildings are subjects of
competition; and as this course of procedure and
honourable encounter bids fair (when weeded of
some of its present objections) to open up a good
and honourable system, whereby the “race <em>may
be</em> to the swift,” the importance of the following
brief and simple Treatise on the subject, becomes
doubly clear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The art of Architectural Modelling is not so
difficult to acquire, as an observer, examining a
model and admiring the minuteness of its parts,
would be led to suppose. But in order to gain a
certain degree of proficiency, a large amount of
patience and perseverance is absolutely necessary.
The great beauties of a model consist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>firstly, in perfect symmetry and correctness of
parts, all the angles being clear, well-defined,
and sharp, the various minutiæ of detail accurately
delineated; and secondly, to the straightness
and evenness of the horizontal and perpendicular
lines. It will be, therefore, readily
understood, that it is these portions of the
manipulation which demand the student’s attention,
more particularly as the joining of the paper
or cardboard by means of a mitre, as well as the
cutting of lines on the slant in either a horizontal
or curved direction, is somewhat difficult. These
difficulties which arise in the student’s path
are, however, easily to be overcome, and he must
not grow faint-hearted if, after repeated trials, he
does not succeed in producing the required
effect. Rather at this juncture let him examine
some model by an adept in the art, comparing
his work with it. By these means he will be
enabled to see the points in his own requiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>improvement, and then let him continue to
labour perseveringly and diligently until he gains
a perfect command of his knife and materials,
and few will be found but will admit that the
result at last obtained fully repays him for his
time and labour. There is no doubt that the
art is of very great antiquity, and that in former
times no building of importance was erected
without one having been previously constructed.
This not only aided the successful carrying out
of the architect’s drawings, but enabled him and
his employer to judge better as to the general
effect the work would have when completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have mention made of models as early as
1546, when San Gallo (a pupil of Bramante, the
original architect of St. Peter’s, at Rome), either
himself constructed, or caused to be, a model
of his proposed designs for that magnificent
structure, in order that the whole might be
carried out in the same spirit in the event of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>his death. On this latter event occurring, the
immortal Michael Angelo Buonarotti undertook
the important office of architect to St. Peter’s.
One of his first tasks was to set aside the model
of his predecessor, which had occupied many
years in constructing, at a cost of many thousand
pounds, while he constructed himself, at a trifling
expense and in a few days, another model of his
intended work. Numerous other instances of
the practical utility of this branch of art might
be cited, but the author deems it unnecessary,
its importance being at once obvious; and this
little work, though devoid of all technicalities, too
frequently the fault of works of this description,
yet is intended shall be eminently practical. To
a large and increasing body, the architectural
assistants, it is hoped that this little hand-book
will prove to be acceptable; and though written
principally for the professional man, it is hoped
it may not prove utterly useless or uninteresting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to others, who though not members of the
architectural profession may yet possess sufficient
taste and skill to wish to perpetuate</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>A DESIGN IN PAPER.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>PART I.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE MATERIALS REQUIRED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The materials the architectural modeller will
require for his work, are, for the most part,
few, simple, and inexpensive. They are also
easily procured at any of the Artists’ Repositories.
It is not, therefore, so much in the
material employed, but in the skill displayed
in the working, that the beauties of a model
consist. The principle in this description of
modelling being, that every possible part be
constructed of paper, it is necessary that this
should be procured of the description best suited
to the nature of the work, and of the best
possible quality. Inferior papers are hard,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>contain knots and other imperfections, and are
very frequently gritty; this latter imperfection,
by destroying the delicate edge of the knife,
prevents the work having that sharp appearance
so much to be desired. The paper I
use, and have always found the best for all
purposes, has a surface similar to that of
Whatman’s double-elephant drawing paper, and
is, I believe, sold under the name of Crayon
paper: a specimen is bound with this book,
forming the <em>next page</em>; it is of a pale cream-colour,
bearing a strong semblance in tint to
Bath-stone, but I have procured it from this
to the shades necessary for the roofs of models.
It is firm, though not hard, in texture, and not
being too spongy, does not absorb to too great
a degree the paste used in fastening together
the sheets for the various thicknesses required,
thus ensuring their firmness, a matter of the
highest importance, otherwise in thin strips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>consisting of four, five, or more thicknesses of
paper, upon their being cut each would part
and defeat the desired end.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most useful tint of this paper is the one
already described, as it can be easily tinted
to represent bricks or rubble, &amp;c., should it be
necessary,—for instance, in a building where the
quoins, dressings, &amp;c., were in stone, the rest
in random rubble or brick, it would enable
you to mark them with a HHH pencil, and
tint before your work was made up. I have
constructed several models in pure white Bristol
board, but it is a tedious hard material to
work in, though the result is very fine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next most important auxiliary is an adhesive
material for fastening the sheets together
to produce the necessary thicknesses of cardboard,
and to fix the whole together and the
several parts in their places. For the former
a paste of flour made in the following manner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>will be found to be the best. To every two tablespoonfuls
of the best wheaten flour, add a teaspoonful
of common moist or brown sugar, and
a little corrosive sublimate, the whole to be
boiled, and while boiling continually stirred to
prevent lumps, till of the right consistency.
If a few drops of some essential oil, say lavender
or peppermint, be added, the usual mouldiness
will not appear, and the paste will keep for a
great length of time. For the latter, a gum
must be used, prepared by the following proportions.
To each six ounces of the best gum
arabic, add an ounce or less of moist or lump
sugar, one teaspoonful of lavender or other
essential oil, and a table-spoonful of gin, the
whole to be mixed in <em>cold</em> water (no heat
being in any way applied) to the consistency of
a thick syrup.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other requisites are sheets of mica or talc, to
be procured at the ironmonger’s, and used for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>windows, skylights, &amp;c.; pieces of soft deal or
beech wood, to form any small detail such as
pinnacles to barge boards, &amp;c., that it may
not be advisable or possible to form in paper;
wire, lead, cord, velvet, and numerous other
nick-nacks, which will occur to the modeller
as his work proceeds, and which will hereafter,
in their place, be carefully described.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>PART II.<br /> <span class='large'>OF THE INSTRUMENTS NECESSARY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The first thing the artist must procure must
be a board of fine, close-grained wood, free from
knots, to prepare and cut the several parts of
his work upon. The best for this cutting-board
is beech, sycamore, or pear-tree wood; it should
be, at the least, one and a-half inch thick, by
twelve inches broad, and about eighteen inches
in length. I should prefer it even thicker than
stated, as continual planing of the surface to
erase the marks of the knife soon reduces its
thickness. Let it be squared perfectly every
way to allow the T square to work accurately
along its edge. As before stated, care must be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>taken, when the surface has become too much cut
up, to have it re-planed, or otherwise the knife
is apt to follow the marks in the board, and cut
the paper irregularly upon the under side. The
size of board mentioned will be found most useful
for all ordinary purposes; should the work
be of very large dimensions, of course another
must be procured, proportionally larger. Two or
three boards of close-grained deal will also be
found of service for cutting obliquely, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE MODELLING PRESS.</h3>

<p class='c011'>This apparatus will be found of essential
service to the artist, as by its aid he forms the
cardboard which is the basis of his model. It
may be either of iron or wood; the former is
lighter, and more elegant in appearance, but the
latter, though plain and homely, is in my opinion
preferable in many respects. A common copying
press may be used, care being taken not to place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the damp paper between the iron, but between
two hard, close-grained pieces of wood. On
page <a href='#Page_27'>27</a> is an illustration of the press I use,
which any joiner can construct for a few shillings.
It consists of a cross-beam, <span class='fss'>A</span>, through which
the screw passes; two uprights, <span class='sc'>B&thinsp;B</span>; a bottom,
<span class='fss'>C</span>, to which, and to the cross-beam, the uprights
must be firmly mortised. Between them is a
moveable top-piece, <span class='fss'>D</span>, which by means of cord
running through two small pulleys, <span class='sc'>E&thinsp;E</span>, keeps
it pressing continually against the screw; the
weight <span class='fss'>F</span>, at the end of the cord being slightly
heavier than will balance the top-piece. By
these means, as you unwind the screw, either to
place under, or look at the progress of work
already there, the top-piece moves out of your
way. The sizes of the wood for the different
portions is given, and care must be observed in
not breaking it by too great a pressure of the
screw; as the object of the press is to keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the sheets flatly and firmly together, while the
adhesive material sets, no undue degree of force
is necessary; indeed it will, for reasons hereafter
to be described, be found a disadvantage to press
them too closely.</p>

<p>THE T-SQUARE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This square is formed like the ordinary
drawing-squares, with the exception that the
blade <span class='fss'>A</span> is made of steel; this is firmly screwed to
a stock of hard wood, which has on each side of
the blade a small piece at <span class='sc'>C&thinsp;C</span> cut out; the object of
this is to allow the knife to cut completely to the
edge of the paper. The advantage, in fact, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>necessity for a steel blade, will be obvious; were
it of wood, the pressure of the knife along its
edge would indent, or cut it. This square will
be found adapted for every description of large
and small work, but should the cardboard be of
great thickness it is apt to stir, and by so doing
cause irregularity of line. To remedy this an
instrument is used, called an adjusting straight-edge.
<span class='fss'>A</span> is a straight ruler of flat brass, or of
steel, like the blade of the T-square. It is contrived
to move to and from the surface of the
board upon the upright screws, <span class='sc'>B&thinsp;B</span>, while a dovetail
groove is fitted with a piece of brass to run
along it, to allow of the horizontal movement of
the ruler. The paper (upon which the cutting-off
line has been previously marked) is placed upon
the board, the straight-edge adjusted to the
line; the straight-edge being then firmly screwed
down upon it by means of the two small thumb-screws,
3 3, it is rendered immoveable during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>progress of the work, this will be better understood
from the annexed engraving.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>MODELLING KNIVES.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>This instrument will be found particularly
useful in cutting the necessary mitres for joining
together the edges of the work, or for any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>work of similar description, such as the copings
to walls, mouldings of every description, &amp;c., &amp;c.
Having now described these very important
instruments in a way we hope may prove perfectly
intelligible, we proceed to state the requirements
in those necessary ones, knives. The
number of these the artist will use, is regulated
more by his own fancy than anything else; but
there are three shapes he will find absolutely
necessary. In modelling, as in painting, there are
numerous tricks and contrivances for producing
various effects; and as the painter will often value
a bit of old scrubby, worn-down brush, so the
modeller will find various cutting instruments
materially assist him, such as the broken blade
of a knife, a steel pen, a bradawl, &amp;c., &amp;c., many
of these producing effects that more elaborate
instruments would have failed doing. On page
<a href='#p033'>33</a> will be found an engraving representing three
requisite varieties of knives. No. 1. This knife is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>long in the blade, and, as will be found in all the
others, is perfectly straight on the cutting edge;
this knife is used to cut straight lines in all
directions through strong work, cutting oblique
lines, mitres, splays, &amp;c. No. 2. One for lighter
work used in forming or modelling ornaments,
or, in general, cutting work of a lighter and neater
character. No. 3. This blade is used solely for
cutting all descriptions of circular work, and
curves of every description. It may be useful to
remark that this is the only shape of blade that
will cut, with clearness and sharpness, curved
lines through thick cardboard. The instrument
next illustrated is called a knife compass, and is
extremely valuable for cutting out circular architraves,
&amp;c., &amp;c., doing its work in a way that the
hand and knife could not equal, and with the
least possible trouble. See illustration, page <a href='#Page_36'>36</a>.
They resemble, in some respects, an ordinary pair
of compasses, but of a little stronger make than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the common. <span class='fss'>A</span> is a moveable sweep of brass,
to regulate the opening of the legs of the compasses,
which, being opened to the requisite
width, are firmly held by tightening the thumb-screw,
<span class='fss'>F</span>. <span class='fss'>B</span>, the moveable leg to which the
cutting-knife <span class='fss'>C</span> is attached by means of a shoulder
to the blade at <span class='fss'>G</span>, and a socket at <span class='fss'>H</span>, into which
it fixes, and is secured by the screw at <span class='fss'>D</span>. <span class='fss'>E</span> and
<span class='fss'>I</span> are two screws working on the rod, <span class='fss'>K</span>, on each
side of the moveable bar, <span class='fss'>B</span>.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_p036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE KNIFE COMPASS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>By means of this contrivance the knife is
always kept perfectly upright, and in consequence
cuts perpendicularly through the cardboard.
There may be several knives to fit in
the socket for light and heavy work, but a blade
of the same shape as that shown in the engraving,
will be found sufficient for nearly every purpose.
The instrument might perhaps be more useful if
half as large again as represented. The dotted
lines are given to show the instrument open
wider, in order fully to illustrate the utility of
the moveable leg at <span class='fss'>B</span>. The method of using
this instrument is this: Having a curve to cut,
and having found the centre of the arc, place the
point of the leg <span class='fss'>L</span> within it, then adjusting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>moveable leg to the perpendicular by means of
the screws <span class='fss'>I</span> and <span class='fss'>E</span>, stretch the legs to the
requisite radius, and by gradually increasing the
pressure on the blade, the curve may be cut with
the most perfect ease and truth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Assuming that the student has now procured
the various instruments and materials for his
work, and that he has also determined upon the
design he intends in paper, the next thing necessary
is to give him as far as it is possible by a
book copiously illustrated, an exact description
of the method of proceeding. We will therefore
imagine a design which is to be modelled (see
frontispiece), a Villa, in the domestic Italian
style, for example; and taking it to pieces bit by
bit, endeavour to raise it up again in renewed
beauty and effect.</p>

size of the intended model, and upon it strain as
for a drawing that size, a piece of drawing cartridge,
say an inch and a half wider all round
than the intended model is to be. Upon this,
when dry, draw an <em>outline plan</em> of the intended
building, not putting in any internal walls, for
these will not be required as this is only to form
lines whereon to erect the intended building.
To make it more readily to be understood we
have given a sketch of the outline plan on

<p class='c000'>This being completed, we have now the edifice,
as it were, set out. The next matter for consideration
is the thickness of the walls; that is,
the requisite thickness of paper we shall require.
Suppose we take, as in the plan given, the outside
reveal or recess back of the window frame,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>at four inches and a half; this would require
four sheets of paper, but as it is always better to
exaggerate slightly in modelling both projections
and recesses, place six or even seven sheets
together; paste them together in twos, putting
them as pasted under the press, and afterwards,
when nearly dry, paste them the full thickness
required and subject them once more to the
action of the press. The most convenient size
of paper to work at for an ordinary-sized model
will be made by doubling a sheet of the paper
as first procured into four. On the paper
becoming perfectly dry, the student must carefully
draw each elevation of the building the full
height from the ground line to the top of the
blocking, being particular that every line both
perpendicular and horizontal is perfectly true
and square, and marking along faintly the lines
for the cornice, strings, &amp;c., &amp;c., that may occur.
This being done and the whole drawn in, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>course not drawing in the window frames but
merely the outline of the square of the window,
the side will present the appearance shown in
the accompanying elevation, and which is merely
sketched and not drawn to any scale.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The four or more elevations having been
drawn, proceed to cut out all windows, doors, and
other openings cleanly and accurately. The
windows and their frames must now be made and
gummed at the back of the several openings;
where panels occur paper of the same tint must
be used, sometimes the pieces cut from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>windows will form very good backing for such
parts. For the window frames take some large-sized
cream laid paper, and colour it to the tint
you wish your frames to be. Should a representation
of oak be preferred, it may be imitated
successfully thus: First paint your paper yellow,
gamboge and a little burnt sienna will do, and
then prepare a thick colour with Chinese white
and burnt sienna; when the first colour is dry
lay this last-mentioned on, and before <em>it</em> has
time to dry grain it by means of a fine comb;
a small tooth comb will answer best for this
purpose, and if skilfully performed a most
admirable imitation will be the result. Three
or four thicknesses of paper (cream laid or other
white paper) must then be pasted together, with
the oak-coloured one upon the top, and submitted
to the action of the press.</p>

<p class='c000'>This paper being ready for use, take one of
the pieces cut from the windows, and mark by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>it the size of the window-opening, then lightly
draw the frames in and cut them out, if the
white paper of the under sheets should show
where cut through sectionally, touch it along
with a little burnt sienna or brown colour.
You must now tint another sheet of the same
description of paper blue or neutral, not in an
even tint, but carelessly and artistically leaving
bright lights; this when pasted as for
the oak-paper two or three thicknesses, will
form the backing to the frames. Then place
the frames face down, on them gummed a sheet
of mica; on that again the blue backing; the
whole then to be put in the press, care being
taken not exhibit too much pressure, otherwise
you will have the backing bulge out. It may,
perhaps, be thought that these thicknesses of
paper for the frames and backing are unnecessary,
and that one might serve as well; but from
experience I can assert, that unless this method
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>be adopted, that flatness the work should have,
will not be obtained. It may also be as well
here to caution the reader against pressing with
too great a degree upon the cardboard when
it is under the action of the press. If too
great a pressure is given, the cardboard will
become so hard as to resist all efforts of the
knife to cut through it. The paper usually
presses to a little less than an inch, to a
scale of one-eighth of an inch to the foot; so
that six thicknesses or sheets of paper will
answer for four and a half of brickwork or
stonework. The doors will be formed first from
two thicknesses<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> and backed with the same.
This is for plainest description, but if mouldings
are inserted in the panels, adopt the
following:—</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One thickness, two thicknesses, three thicknesses, and so forth,

<p>PLAN OF ENTRANCE DOOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>First draw the door with the extreme size of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>the opening of each panel, on a two-thickness
sheet; on another two-thickness sheet, draw the
same panels a size smaller; on a third two-thickness
sheet, draw them a size smaller still;
these being cut out and placed behind one
another, and finally the backing; will admirably
represent mouldings: by producing three separate
lines round the inside of each panel. For work
to ⅛ scale no further trouble will be necessary;
but if larger, the mouldings must be formed
before the door is gummed together, as hereafter
described for the formation of mouldings in
general. The doors, windows, and backs to all
openings are now ready, but cannot be yet fixed
till all the necessary mitreing is completed, which
mitres will be wherever an outside angle occurs
thus, fig. 1. (See page <a href='#Page_53'>53</a>, figs. 1 and 2.)</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Fig. 2.<br /><br />INSIDE ANGLE.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In the inner angle (see fig. 2) no mitre is
required; the end of one piece being cut square,
they may be made to overlap one another. Lay
the piece, whatever it may be you wish to mitre,
face down upon the cutting-board; and then at
a distance (equal to the whole thickness of the
cardboard) from the edge draw a line; and at a
short distance back from this line sufficient to
let the point of the knife touch it when held
slanting to the required angle, fix the adjusting
straight-edge previously described; screw firmly
upon it, and cut through the paper at an angle
of 45°, which will, of course, be by cutting from
the line on the top side of the paper, <span class='fss'>A</span>, to the
extreme edge of the underside, <span class='fss'>B</span> (see illustration
page <a href='#Page_55'>55</a>), which represents the side of a building,
and the piece may be seen curling up as cut
from the mitre. Great steadiness of hand, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>a few trials on waste cardboard are necessary
before the operator will perform this skilfully.
The straight-edge holding the paper firmly, it
may be cut through at two or three strokes,
observing to hold the knife always at the same
angle. All mitreing work finished, affix the
windows at the back, placing the whole under a
slight pressure.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Then the model must be blocked
up. First cut a number of squares, all sizes, from
waste or other cardboard; let them be perfectly
square; cut these diagonally, and they will form
the blocks to hold the work together at the angles.
Now take any two sides that are to be joined
at the mitred angle, and fix them accurately
together with gum pretty thick, so that it may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>dry while you hold each side in its place. When
set, lay them down and work the others in a
similar manner. Take now the outline plan,
and having previously numbered the sides to
correspond with the plan, fix them (by touching
slightly their under edge with gum) to it, and
when all are in their places fix, at a distance
apart of an inch and half or so, above one
another the previously described blocking pieces
with gum not so thick in consistency. To make
our meaning perfectly plain, we annex an engraving
of the appearance of an internal angle
when at this stage of the proceedings. A piece
of wood (deal) about ½ inch thick, should now be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>attached to the model from one side to the other
(see page <a href='#Page_57'>57</a>). This is for the purpose of fastening
the model, when completed, to its stand; it may
be blocked with waste pieces, such as the cuttings
from doors, windows, &amp;c., and gummed firmly.
Pieces or strips of cardboard should also be
gummed along in the inside, at the level of the
intended gutters of the house, to rest the roof
upon. All portions of the work completed, we will
now assume, are fitted together and in their places.
The student will now be able to form some idea
of the general effect his work will have when
finished; but there is yet more—much more—to
be done, and work requiring a still further amount
of skill, practice, and patience.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As there are many little matters during the progress of a
model requiring a slight pressure, a pressure sufficient to hold the
pieces in their several places till dry, I have found weights answer
very well. I have pieces of square lead from one pound upwards
covered with paper; and by covering, the humble brick may be
usefully pressed into this service.</p>

of the details are given to a larger scale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cornice next demands our attention, a
detail of which is given on page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>, fig. 1, and in
order to model which we proceed thus, the numbers
indicating the various pieces of which it is
composed. No. 2 is a piece worked of the required
thickness demanded by the depth of the
cornice from <span class='fss'>A</span> to <span class='fss'>B</span>, and the necessary projection,
in a sufficient series of lengths to go entirely
round the building. Now, as this is to be cut
through the several thicknesses of paper required,
a method must be found out to hide the different
layers that would consequently be exposed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>view; this is by cutting from one or two thicknesses
a piece the whole length of the cornice,
forming a facia, 8, and coming slightly below the
depth of the other under piece to 4; thus, while
at the same time it hides the layers of paper, it
forms the bed of the cornice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next members, Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7, are
formed, first by preparing the size and length on
the square; secondly, by cutting off at any angle
necessary to get as near to the mould as possible;
and, lastly, forming the mould itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner of moulding being applicable to
every description of either Italian or Gothic
pattern, we proceed to describe it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Procure from the comb-manufacturers some
pieces of <em>ivory</em> of various sizes, and with different

<p class='c000'>Nos. 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., &amp;c., will be found generally
available and useful in the formation of all kinds
of mouldings, besides numbers of other shapes
that will occur to the artist. The method of
using the instrument is by indenting the pattern
along the edge of the cardboard, guided by
means of the straight-edge. The sharp arris
left from the file upon the edge of the ivory
mould, had better be slightly taken off, to prevent
the paper being torn in its passage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The circular pediment over windows (fig. 2,
page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>) must be modelled on the flat, and the
moulding returned at the ends. When each
member is finished, they must be gummed up
and bent to the required curve, over a circle
of cardboard or a cylinder of wood, separately.
The panels that occur form thus: Cut as before
directed for doors, the extreme size of the
opening, and at the back place the successive
sizes and thicknesses to form the mouldings,
indented into hollows or worked to rounds, &amp;c.,
&amp;c., by means of one or more of the moulding
tools; to be backed last of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Commence the preparation of the quoins (fig. 6,
p. <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>) by cutting pieces the required thickness and
width of both long and short quoins, and in long

<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>When dry cut off by the divisional line, and then

thick to allow of the highest mould of the
architrave abutting against it, and either left
plain, cut diamond-wise, or carved, or any

demand.</p>

procuring a piece of very thin copper or lead,
mark on it with considerable accuracy the design
of the cantaliver, and cut it out; you will thus
have prepared a mould or templet, which you
can place upon the cardboard, and by running
a hard pencil round it, mark each one precisely
the same in size.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any portions of the dressings, &amp;c., having

<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>No. 3<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a>; in fact, this is the only shape of blade

<p class='c000'>The positions the cantalivers have to occupy

regularly divided. Care must also be taken in
gumming them in their places, as one out of
place or leaning would immediately be detected
by a correct eye, and mar completely the effect
of the whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>The architrave mould (fig. 3, page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>) next
demands our attention. It will from our
former description be readily understood that
all mouldings are formed by representing in
paper of various thicknesses their several component
parts. Thus, in the mould last named,
we have first the groundwork of or thickness
from <span class='fss'>A</span> to <span class='fss'>B</span>; another thickness, forming the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>sinking, from <span class='fss'>C</span> to <span class='fss'>D</span>; and finally, the mould,
<span class='fss'>E</span> to <span class='fss'>F</span>. Square first, the required slant next cut
from the edge, and lastly, the slant hollowed by
means of one of the ivory moulding tools. The
keystones and the blocks under the window sills
are cut from paper the thickness required, then
splayed down each way from the centre to the
sides at <em>one</em> cut, and with a sharp knife. This
operation must be performed with some dexterity,
as it is important that the edges should be sharp
and free from woolliness. This effect can only be
obtained by giving one cut or slice in the
direction required: for this purpose use
knife No. 1, which will be found the best for
this description of work. Some modellers use for
this purpose a thin chisel with a keen edge; and
of course all means in art are legitimate that
produce the desired end; but we would recommend
the use of the knife only, wherever possible,
the modeller’s object being to work with as few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>tools as possible, and to trust much to his knife
alone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>We have, in describing the method of working
several important details connected with the
building, and illustrated on page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>, been, we
fear, somewhat premature, and have not sufficiently
urged upon the student the necessity of
preparing his groundwork for these details in a
perfectly accurate manner. For, as it is well
known, no colouring, however fine, will in a
picture make up for bad and incorrect drawing,
so in a model, walls out of square or windows
and other apertures ill-cut will not present the
wished-for appearance, though all the details be
most skilfully and beautifully modelled. Draw
in all doors, windows, &amp;c., &amp;c., with a very hard
pencil, in order that the lines may be as fine as
possible, and cut them out with knife No. 1,
or No. 2, whichever may be considered most
suitable to the size of opening it is required to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>cut; the knife No. 3, as before observed, being
used exclusively for curved and circular work.
In cutting out the windows, hold your knife perfectly
upright; and, as you arrive at the end of
the cut, let the <em>edge</em> of the blade be perpendicular,
thus avoiding cutting past the line. In cutting
through thick, or indeed even through one thickness
of paper, do not be too anxious to sever the
piece with one cut, as this way of proceeding is
almost sure to cause unevenness of line. But
commence by <em>drawing</em> a line, as it were, in the
required direction; that the rule may guide it
accurately, press but slightly at first; and as
the track of the knife gets deeper, exert more
pressure. Simple as this direction may appear,
it is nevertheless of the utmost practical utility,
as will readily be found upon trial, as it is only
by these means that the paper will be left at the
edge clean, sharp, and even.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next object we would call attention to is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the Greenhouse, page <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>, and state that there are
two ways of modelling this very general appendage
to a modern mansion. The first and the simplest
method is to form the backing of blue paper behind
the mica. The other, by doing away with
the blue backing, and allowing the mica to remain
transparent. The former method saves some
amount of labour; but the latter being in our
opinion the best and most artistic method, we
shall proceed to describe it: First form the pilasters
(you will require double the number than
for the opaque backing), and cut them in their
length from <span class='fss'>A</span> to <span class='fss'>B</span> (see elevation, page <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>), from
the commencement of the base mouldings to the
underside of those of the cap. The way of
proceeding in modelling cap and base will be
readily understood from the accompanying
sketch, where it will at once be seen better than
we can describe. The best way to cut them is
as if they were a window or opening, cutting the
piece out of the centre at <span class='fss'>A</span>, after having moulded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>the edge all round. Then dividing them into two
along the line <span class='sc'>D&thinsp;L</span> as below, fix them in their
respective places. The angle ones must be double,
to avoid having to mitre them. A piece of mica
or thin glass cut to the size of the one side is
now taken, and the pilasters and other portions,
divisional bars, &amp;c., are gummed to it, on both
sides; and when with the end it is finished, let
it occupy its intended position on the outline
plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now proceed to the roof, to be constructed
really of iron and glass, to be modelled of paper
and mica: First, bend round a paper or other
cylinder the piece of mica for the roof, and proceed
to cut a number of strips of cardboard for
the ribs, which may be coloured any suitable tint.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chimneys, those great ornaments to a house,
at least they should be rendered so, but, alas!
for the taste of some of our modern architects,
are far more frequently the reverse, and what
in able hands and with judicious treatment
would prove a crowning feature and a material
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>assistance to the design, becomes a glaring error
and ruins the whole. So much for the architect:
but should he fortunately possess the ability and
taste to produce those necessaries to our comfort,
with equal credit to himself and benefit to the
design, how often do we see his work marred by
the introduction of Messrs. Somebody’s patent
never-failing revolving smoke preventer; a hideous
monster of some seven feet high, whirling and
screeching upon the slightest appearance of wind.
As our little Handbook has its mission to instruct
in the Art of Modelling an architect’s production,
and as smoke-jacks are but little indebted to him
for their uneasy existence, we beg to apologise
for this digression, and resume our original topic.
Details of the chimneys will be found upon page
<a href='#Page_81'>81</a> and <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>; for the body of the chimney use two
thicknesses, and it will not be found necessary to
mitre the join; for, if even ordinary care be taken,
the union will be scarcely perceptible, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>labour will be considerably diminished. Form
any strings, cornices, &amp;c., &amp;c., that occur, by
cutting the piece flat, and then cutting the square
out of the middle to admit of the shaft, slip it
over the shaft or body of the chimney, till it
arrives at the position required by the design,
where it is at once to be secured in its place.
Perhaps our meaning may be rendered clearer by
the accompanying illustration. <span class='fss'>A</span> represents the
cornice prepared in the manner described, and only
requiring to be fixed in its place. <span class='fss'>B</span>, the shaft
or body of the chimney over which the cornice
is to be slipped till it arrives at the dotted lines;
the chimneys may be fixed to the roof (shortly to
be described) in the following manner: Should
the chimney come on the roof lower down than
the ridge, the bottom of the shaft will have to
be cut to the angle required by the rake of the
roof only; but should the chimney be cut into
by the ridge, then the angle will follow that of
the roof on both sides, diverging from the apex.
For illustration of this we give the annexed
sketches, page <a href='#Page_83'>83</a>.</p>

<p>DETAILS OF CHIMNEYS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='fss'>A</span> represents a chimney, the base of which is
cut simply <em>one way</em>, to suit the slope of the roof.
<span class='fss'>B</span>, a chimney into which the ridge cuts, and the
angle cut both ways from the apex. It will, as
a general rule, be found better to put chimneys
together with thin paper, even in the smallest
models, a squareness being thus produced not to
be obtained otherwise. The base to be formed
out of thickness equal to the projection, and
treated in (as regards fitting it to the roof) a similar
manner to the shaft, so that if the rake of shaft
had chanced not to have been truly cut, there is
no need to throw it away, as it could easily be
blocked under with small pieces till straight, the
base hiding all defects underneath. The method
of working the strings, cornices, &amp;c., has already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>been fully described in those for the tower and
main building. Figs. 1 and 7, page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our model now draws near to its completion.
We had arrived at a stage ready for the roof,
but stopped for the preparation of the chimneys,
in order that when the roof was completed, they
might be at once fixed in their respective places.
The roof may be either scored, or gauged with
paper strips overlapped. The groundwork for
either method will be prepared in the same
manner. First cut, as if for a lid or top to fit
the inside of the model, a strong piece of cardboard;
let it be just so that it will slip into its
place between the walls, but be prevented slipping
down by the strips or ledge on the level of the
gutter, as described for Greenhouse, page <a href='#Page_73'>73</a>.</p>

<p>Fig. 3.<br /><br />ROOF PLAN.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Sections must now be taken in various parts,
through the roof, to ascertain the length of the
respective sides. Thus if the angle <span class='sc'>A&thinsp;B&thinsp;C</span> (see fig. 1,
page <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>) represents the rake of the roof, the length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of the side will be found from <span class='fss'>A</span> to <span class='fss'>B</span> and <span class='fss'>B</span> to <span class='fss'>C</span>.
The sides thus formed must be splayed to fit at
the valleys, apex, &amp;c., and at the base splayed
and fixed to the top piece on which the roof plan
has been drawn, observing to leave space enough
all round for the gutter. If the pieces on which
the sections have been drawn are cut out, they
will answer for internal stays to the roof.</p>

<p class='c000'>The roof plan is given upon page <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>, fig. 3,
as also an outline section for the finishing of the
roof, fig. 2, page <a href='#Page_85'>85</a>; it will explain itself. The
lead flat will be formed by the bottom piece,
but it must be covered by a paper resembling
in tint that of the lead itself. When the groundwork
of the roof is completed, it must be
covered in imitation of slates by one or other
of the previously-mentioned methods. We will,
however, describe both, leaving the reader to
use his own judgment as to which he may adopt,
our preference being for the strips of overlapping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>paper. In the simple scoring, proceed to cut out
of the slate tinted paper pieces accurately fitting
to the groundwork of the roof, then with the
knife handle score these sides along, as you
would ink in the roof lines in a drawing, closer
at the ridge, becoming wider at the base, and
parallel to each other. The latter by cutting
layers of paper, gauged decreasing in size as
before directed, fixing them to the groundwork of
the roof beginning at the base, and overlapping
them about <sup><span class='xxsmall'>1</span></sup>⁄<span class='xxsmall'>16</span>th of an inch; after all, submitting
to the press. The roof assumed to be finished,
affix the chimneys, generally make good all
imperfections, &amp;c., and the model is ready for
removal to its final destination; cut therefore
the paper it was built upon from the board, and
also tear from the bottom edges the paper that
may have adhered to it, holding it by the wood
stay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Prepare a piece of dry wood about two or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>three inches wider all round than the building
itself, cover it with cloth or velvet, the latter
preferable, the best colour green, and cut a small
groove out of the upper edge; this is to receive the
glass shade, which construct thus: procure five
pieces of glass, the sizes rendered necessary by
your stand to form a square or oblong shade, and
fasten all together by means of strips of thin
paper and gum (the dull gold paper to be procured
in sheets at any of the artists’ repositories
will look best) at their edges. The model must
now be secured to the stand, for which purpose
the piece of wood mentioned at page <a href='#Page_56'>56</a> was
inserted, a hole is drilled through the bottom of
the stand, and a screw passed through it into
the wood stay. Do not screw the model down too
tightly upon the stand, or you may force away the
stay from its fastenings and destroy your work.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now described all the necessary materials
and manipulations to complete in every
respect a model similar to the mansion given in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the illustrations, and which, though containing
the general detail of a building of that description,
was wanting in numerous varieties of detail
that will occur in many other buildings of the
same class more ornate and considerably more
elaborate in design than our example.</p>

<p class='c000'>While all our attention is being turned towards
Italian architecture, Gothic must not be forgotten,
and though the general method of procedure
is the same for both, yet there are
numerous things which exist only in the latter
style, and in consequence demand separate
instructions. In order, therefore, that nothing
shall escape being described in the various styles,
that the student may have nothing to retard his
operations, we append the methods of working
the various details in the form of an illustrated
glossary, the alphabetical arrangement of which
will, we think, enable the student more readily
and quickly to find the particular information he
may require.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PART IV.<br /> <span class='large'>HINTS ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING; LAYING OUT GROUNDS, &amp;c.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We have, as yet, proposed to finish the model
in the plainest and most simple way, completely
unaided and unadorned by the adjuncts of gardens
or trees. And yet, that models are frequently
considerably improved in appearance by these
imitations of natural objects, when taste and skill
go hand in hand, will be admitted by all, but we
often see them completely spoiled by such additions.
It is indeed somewhat difficult to say how
far we may venture with propriety upon this path,
and where to draw the line requires some tact; we
will not, therefore, lay down any rule absolutely as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to how far the laying out of grounds and the
modelling of the trees, &amp;c., may be admissible,
only giving some instructions for modelling the
objects themselves. And though the grounds
are laid out, the picturesque undulations of the
surface, the ponds, flower-beds, arcades, terraces,
lawns, shrubs, and trees, faithfully represented,
let it not for one moment be supposed that by
so doing we render what was before a work
of art, a mere toy. Far from it. We do not
wish the reader, when he thinks of a model, to
remember those of York Minster, or Strasbourg
Cathedral, and which, borne aloft upon the
shoulders of some wandering Italian, tempt the
vulgar by the rich colours of the stained glass
inserted in their chalk sides, and brilliantly
illuminated by the light of a farthing candle
placed within; or of the grounds, as bearing
any resemblance to those interesting toys representing
a “<em>castle in cork</em>,” about an inch high,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>whose clinging ivy is represented by one of the
largest species of moss, and in whose luxurious
gardens bloom roses two inches in diameter,
roses which should have decked some matron’s
cap, but which for the nonce were pressed into this
more noble service. But, to proceed. Balusters
of grotesque, Elizabethan, or other patterns, when
cut out of the solid stone, must be made by
gumming the paper in different thicknesses, till
that required is obtained, carefully drawing the
pattern, and then cutting out with knife No. 3.
Turned work, as circular pedestals for statues, sundials,
gate-piers, balusters, &amp;c., cannot be successfully
imitated in paper, but are better turned in
wood of some light colour, and then tinted with
body colour to the required shade; all work of the
same description that is <em>square</em> may be constructed
in exactly the same manner as before described
for chimney-stacks. For a representation of lawns
and grassy slopes, meadow, &amp;c., we may take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>white velvet, and tint it to any required shade,
or use cloth which can be obtained any shade of
green, or even flock paper may be procured,
which, when cleverly laid on the work, gives an
excellent imitation of grass; but of all these
methods, velvet tinted will be found the most
effective and best. Water, represent with looking-glass,
or with mica, to the back of which is
gummed paper of suitable tint for the situation
of the water. For rocks, grottoes, &amp;c., take
stout white paper, and thoroughly soak it in
water until it is rendered quite pliable, and then
with the fingers, pieces of wood, or any thing
that may suggest itself as being useful, mould or
model it to the required shapes fancy or skill
may suggest, and afterwards tint it to resemble
nature. An effect better still may be obtained
by gumming it, when perfectly dry, with thick
gum, and then dusting or sprinkling it with fine
sand, which may be procured of various shades.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>This method adopt also for walks, carriage-drives,
or any place where a representation of
road, or gravel, may be required. Cut out your
flower-beds in thin cork, and then burn the upper
surface; this will give the appearance of rich
mould, or earth, and also serve as a good groundwork
to stick the shrubs and flowers into. In
your trees, rather aim at a general or suggestive
effect, than at much minutiæ of detail; procure
pieces of twigs, and shape them for the trunks
and branches, and then gum on them the smallest-leaved
moss, in good outline to represent nature;
this moss will, when perfectly dried, bear tinting
well. Flower-patches, the same moss with a bit
of bright scarlet, or other paper, here and there
gummed among it.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have now given sufficient general instructions
to enable the student to proceed with this
branch, should his fancy lead him; and with
these suggestions, and his own practice, he may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>in a short time be enabled to imitate successfully
the quaint gardens of the Elizabethan period, or
the more natural taste evinced in the landscape
gardening of our own times.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Arch.</span>—As a general rule, every description of arch
may be successfully modelled by means of the knife-compass;
each separate moulding that occurs must
consist of separate pieces of paper, the edge of which
has been moulded by one or other of the means
described, and these layers gummed over one another
when finished. To make our meaning clearer, in fig. 1
next page, a section of a cornice is given, as illustrating
the method to be adopted for arches. It will here be
seen that it is composed of six separate pieces, or, more
properly speaking, thicknesses, for each portion will be
made of the number of thicknesses required by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>depth; No. 1, the fillet, square, No. 2, the cyma recta,
first splay, as shown by the dotted line; and then press

<p class='c000'>Where deep hollows occur, as in Gothic mouldings,
a different method must be adopted, see fig. 2, the
moulding for a Gothic window jamb; here the deep
hollows are constructed by bending thin paper to the

other angles required. <span class='fss'>A</span> and <span class='fss'>B</span> represent the outside
walls of the work, and <span class='sc'>C&thinsp;C&thinsp;C&thinsp;C</span> the various angles required

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Blocking.</span>—To a cornice. This, if large, is best
constructed by being boxed out. If small in size, cut
them out of the solid.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Bracket.</span>—Brackets in Gothic work are to be constructed
in layers, in a similar manner as described for
cornices; other brackets may be cut from the solid
paper, first by making a pattern, or template, in thin
tea lead, or sheet copper, and marking round the edge
upon the paper, uniformity of size being thus ensured.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>C.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Cornices.</span>—The construction of cornices is fully
described in that of the House, illustrated, and also
under the head of Arch, where a cornice is described
as illustrating the formation of moulded arches.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Coins</span>, or <span class='sc'>Quoins</span>; see those described for House,
page <a href='#Page_64'>64</a>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>; also Ashlar-work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Coping.</span>—If the coping be small scale, cut from the
solid by the adjusting straight-edge; otherwise they
are better boxed out.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Cresting.</span>—Proceed in much the same manner as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>described for barge boards; use a template to save
trouble in pencilling out, and cut with knife No. 3;
three thicknesses are ample for eighth scale work.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Cusps.</span>—See description of Tracery; window-cusps
being circular work, No. 3 knife must be used.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Corbel.</span>—Refer to Cantilevers in House Tower
Cornice, the method of modelling being the same,
except such as are composed of a series of horizontal
mouldings, in which case proceed as for cornices.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Console.</span>—The console given for example is composed
vertically of five separate pieces; horizontally of
two, each separate part receiving its proper form, and
when completed, gummed together.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p103.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Capital, Corinthian.</span>—We choose for illustrating
the method adopted for modelling capitals, a Corinthian
one, as most useful for our purpose. The example
given is from the Temple of Vesta, at Tivoli, a beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and peculiar example, to model which proceed thus</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_p104.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>A&thinsp;A&thinsp;A</span> Flowers in the abacus.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; 1 2 3 Abacus.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; <span class='sc'>B&thinsp;B</span> Volutes.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196;  <span class='sc'>C&thinsp;C</span> Caulicoles.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; <span class='fss'>C</span>* Bell.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; 1 2 3 Astragal.&#8196; &#8196; &#8196; <span class='sc'>D&thinsp;D&thinsp;D</span> Flutes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Compose the abacus of three layers, 1, ovolo, 2, fillet,
3, cyma; then the bell of the capital must be turned
out of some close-grained wood, and attached to the
astragal, composed of three pieces, 1, fillet, 2, astragal,
3, fillet. The leaves are then to be modelled, as
described under the head of ornaments, also the flower
in the abacus; the volutes and caulicoles in a similar
manner to that described for consoles. When all are
prepared, they must be fixed most accurately in their
places. The bell of the capital must be tinted previously,
to resemble in colour the rest of the work.</p>

<div  class='figright id008'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
<img src='images/i_p105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Column, Circular.</span>—This description of columns
must be formed out of very thin paper, rolled as close
as possible to the required lengths and diameters,
thinning the paper at the extreme edge with a very
sharp knife to conceal the join. If the columns are
too small to be cleverly rolled, they may be turned as
described for balusters; should the columns (as in
classic work,) diminish, then procure a wood core to
roll the paper round, and when the paper is gummed
and dry, withdraw the core. It will now be obvious
that combinations of various descriptions occurring
so frequently in Gothic work, may easily be
represented as this column in plan, being
nothing more than four rolls joined together.
If the columns are too small for paper, turn shafts, bases,
and caps at once; by this means much unnecessary
trouble will be saved, and a superior effect produced.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>D.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Dentils.</span>—Model dentils in the same manner as
previously described for brackets, cantilevers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dome.</span>—Whatever the shape of the dome you wish
to model may be, a pattern on which to form it had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>best be turned in wood; this forms a basis upon
which the paper casing may remain until dry, and then
the mould may be removed. It has not been thought
necessary within the limits of this work to include
the development of the various shapes of domes and
cupolas, the student being deemed master of this
branch of science. If, however, he should not be, any
work on practical geometry will supply his wants.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Doors.</span>—A copious description of the manner of
modelling doors is given in those described for the
House, page <a href='#Page_51'>51</a>, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ante</span></i>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>F.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Flutes.</span>—In order to flute a column, we proceed
thus: first roll the column up as before described,
taking care to have it smaller than if plain, to allow the
fluted piece to make up the required diameter; then
prepare a piece of paper (one thickness will do), cut it
of sufficient size to go once round the column, and
join exactly; upon this piece carefully space or mark
out the divisions of the flutings. Now procure a piece
of soft straight-grained <em>deal</em>, perfectly free from knots,
and with some blunt, round-headed instrument (one
of the modelling tools, or a piece of ivory filed smooth,)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>indent the wood with a groove the exact length of the
required flute, upon which (the paper having been
previously <em>damped</em> only), press it into the wood groove
all along the flute with the same tool the groove was
made with, and so proceed with each in succession,
gumming them to the column when dry.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>H.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hollows.</span>—In forming hollows in mouldings, &amp;c.,
if large, proceed as described under the head of Arch;
if small, first cut by means of the “adjusting straight-edge,”
an angle, thus, <b><span class='large'>V</span></b>; and then with a curved
ivory tool give it the required concavity by pressure
along the whole length of the previously cut angle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Hood Mould.</span>—These may be cut with the
“knife-compass,” and the mouldings worked by fitting
a piece of ivory filed to the required form in lieu of the
knife; they must be slightly gummed upon the underside
to the cutting-board, to keep them steady while
being worked.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>I.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ironwork.</span>—May be represented in either paper,
tea-lead, thin sheet copper, or wire, depending on size
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>and form; perhaps the easiest and best material for
general purposes is tea-lead, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</span></i>, the lead with which
the tea chests are lined.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>O.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ornaments.</span>—Under this head is included every
description of foliage, leaves, &amp;c. All the leaves, &amp;c.,
must be carefully drawn and cut out, and then indented
on either side, as concavity or convexity is desired, in
a similar manner to the operation of fluting a column,
with the different <em>ivory</em> modelling tools on a piece of
soft yielding deal. Bosses, crocketts, finials, festoons,
wreaths, in short every description of foliage, and even
sculpture in bas-relief, may be beautifully modelled by
these simple means.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>T.</h3>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Tracery Window.</span>—The general method of modelling
windows of this description is very simple, but
the practice difficult. First, paper upon which you
intend to cut out any tracery, must be <em>pressed</em> closer
together than that used for ordinary work, so as to
afford more assistance to the knife when cutting on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the splay. Having drawn the design of your window,
proceed to cut out all the interstices with knife No. 3;
then splay down from the nosing with knives Nos. 1
and 2, as each may be found useful, cutting through
with one stroke, or rather with a succession of short
strokes right through on the slant, boldly and without
leaving a jagged edge; afterwards smooth your work
with ivory or agate. You had better place the pieces
that came from between the mullions while cutting
the splay, in their places again between the mullions,
to offer resistance to the knife and prevent them
bending. The eyes may be successfully formed by
packing-needles of diamond shape, fixed in a handle.</p>

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
